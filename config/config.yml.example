# While a lot of configuration in Sentry can be changed via the UI, for all
# new-style config (as of 8.0) you can also declare values here in this file
# to enforce defaults or to ensure they cannot be changed via the UI. For more
# information see the Sentry documentation.

###############
# Mail Server #
###############

# mail.backend: 'smtp'  # Use dummy if you want to disable email entirely
mail.host: 'smtp'
# mail.port: 25
# mail.username: ''
# mail.password: ''
# NOTE: `mail.use-tls` and `mail.use-ssl` are mutually exclusive and should not
#        appear at the same time. Only uncomment one of them.
# mail.use-tls: false
# mail.use-ssl: false

# NOTE: The following 2 configs (mail.from and mail.list-namespace) are set
#       through SENTRY_MAIL_HOST in sentry.conf.py so remove those first if
#       you want your values in this file to be effective!

# The email address to send on behalf of
# mail.from: 'root@localhost' or ...
# mail.from: 'System Administrator <root@localhost>'

# The mailing list namespace for emails sent by this Sentry server.
# This should be a domain you own (often the same domain as the domain
# part of the `mail.from` configuration parameter value) or `localhost`.
# mail.list-namespace: 'localhost'

# If you'd like to configure email replies, enable this.
# mail.enable-replies: true

# When email-replies are enabled, this value is used in the Reply-To header
# mail.reply-hostname: ''

# If you're using mailgun for inbound mail, set your API key and configure a
# route to forward to /api/hooks/mailgun/inbound/
# Also don't forget to set `mail.enable-replies: true` above.
# mail.mailgun-api-key: ''
